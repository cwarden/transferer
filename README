Transferer is a web-based file transfer application built on node.js.  It
doesn't store any files on disk and sends each chunk of each uploaded file to
the downloader as it is received so it doesn't (or shouldn't, at least) use
much memory.

I got the idea for this while reading Joe Armstrong's Erlang book
(http://amzn.to/cpPqJV), although I still haven't gotten around to really
learning Erlang.

Initial upload code adapted from Felix Geisend√∂rfer's work: http://debuggable.com/posts/streaming-file-uploads-with-node-js:4ac094b2-b6c8-4a7f-bd07-28accbdd56cb

The code should be considered prototype quality at this point.

TODO
* Unit tests
* Give the code some structure
